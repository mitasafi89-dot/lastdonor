            How Funds Are Released
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
            Once required verification is complete, the verified available
            amount may be released for withdrawal. The platform currently
            supports lump-sum release after full verification, with withdrawal
            records tracked in the campaign dashboard. Funds usually move
            through Stripe-connected payout rails and arrive according to
            Stripe, bank, and card network timing.
