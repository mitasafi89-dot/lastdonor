        LastDonor accepts donations, not purchases of goods or services. There
        is no shipping, delivery, return window, or product warranty. This
        policy explains when a donation may be refunded and how donors can cancel
        recurring donations.

            email address, donation date, campaign name, amount, and a short
            explanation. We usually review refund requests within 5 business
            days. If approved, the refund is submitted through Stripe and may
            take 5 to 10 business days to appear on the original payment method.

            If something looks wrong, contact us before filing a card dispute so
            we can investigate quickly. If a dispute is opened through a bank or
            card issuer, Stripe and the payment network may request transaction,
            donation, and campaign records from LastDonor. We cooperate with
            legitimate dispute investigations and may pause a campaign while the
            issue is reviewed.
