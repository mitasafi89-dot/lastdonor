            <li>
              <strong>We find the story</strong> - Through news feeds,
              official reports, and community submissions. We go looking for
              people who actually need help.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We check the sources</strong> - At least one primary
              source has to be independently verifiable. We cross-reference
              with multiple sources whenever we can.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>We confirm the need</strong> - We verify that the
              person or family has a real financial need, and that a specific
              dollar amount is justified and not inflated.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A person reviews it</strong> - A member of our
              editorial team reads the campaign for accuracy, tone, and
              completeness. Not an algorithm. A person.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>It goes live with citations</strong> - Every published
              campaign includes source citations so you can verify the story
              yourself if you want to.

              We will never use guilt-based language, manipulative appeals, or

            When We Get Something Wrong

            If we discover an error in a campaign, here is what happens:
          </p>
          <ol className="mt-3 list-decimal space-y-2 pl-6 text-muted-foreground">
            <li>
              We fix it immediately and note the correction on the campaign
              page so everyone can see what changed.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the error is serious (wrong person, incorrect incident), we
              pause the campaign, contact every donor who gave, and publish a
              transparent correction.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a campaign turns out to be based on false information, we
              suspend it, notify donors, and publish a clear explanation.
